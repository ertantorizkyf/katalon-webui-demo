# Katalon WebUI Demo

This is a basic demo project for creating Web UI test cases using **Katalon Studio**.  
It uses the [https://demoqa.com/](https://demoqa.com/) dummy site to showcase how automated browser interactions can be created and validated using Katalon's no-code/low-code test automation platform.
